### Wesley Brueland \| He/Him
</center>
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for figuring out the "how?".
Formerly a rocket surgeon, I've pivoted to the tech world, where I blend my love for science, engineering, and technology with practical applications.

Whether you call me a dog dad, unprofessional video game dev, project mismanager, or city Brent, you'll find me exploring virtual and physical worlds with the same curiosity that drives my professional work. 

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, questions, or just to say hi!
You never know what that side-quest will unlock.
