Welcome to Brue Land! This is a space where I plan on updating whoever is unfortunate enough to stumble here on my current projects. These will be documentations of fun snippets of scripts I write, photos and renderings of 3d models that I create and print, and collections of ideas and projects that are in-progress or completed. This site will be constantly evolving as I tweak and tune it to fit my current desires, and will most likely break as I learn and push my abilities. Currently, my main focus is creating a structure for this project that not only makes sense to me, but will hopefully make sense to future me as I move forward with more adding more content. For now, enjoy wandering around the strange Lands of Brue and be sure to tell you friends if you find anything of value!
