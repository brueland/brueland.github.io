## Fortune Cookies, Spotify Shuffle, and Blasphemy

Hy-Vee has recently kicked off a new promotion called "Fortune Frenzy" where they combine fortune cookies and a [sweepstakes](https://www.hy-vee.com/).

This may not seem like a radical thing to be writing about, but when I first saw an ad for this promotion interrupt my viewing of "Bob's Burgers" the other night, I immediately understood the impact blasphemy must hold for some.

Now, before I jump too far into this, note that I am not actually mad or wanting any change to occur, or really that serious about my feelings of this being blasphemous. But I did recognize some sort of disgust register in my brain when I watched the semi-sacred medium of fortune cookie fortune being turned into a method of selling (pretty decent) fast-food chinese. 

Y'all might disagree with my how highly I value fortunes (and my taste in grocery store hot food), but at any moment, there are most likely fortunes within reach of my most common lived in spaces. My desk, my computer monitors, the frames of kitchen cabinet doors, my wallet, anywhere I have eaten these cookies and found a slight crack I can wedge my paper fates, there is probably one on display.

Why? 

Why not? Who better to manifest good in the world than a tiny piece of trash wedged in a cardboard flavored cookie? It didn't ask to be there, nobody made it law that it has to be, and the whole thing is mostly a made-up gimmick itself to sell more food. But man, I'm still bummed when I crack one open and there's not a scroll telling me my future.

While I'm not one to subscribe to any of the traditional religions, I do fancy myself a smidge spiritual. This mostly is celebrated by myself in the form of aligning my present with the serendipidous. When I pop that cookie open (and eat it completely first, you gotta eat it all before you read the fortune ya know) and read the almost daring "You will be presented with new opportunities" printed next to a few random numbers, I can't help but sync the mass produced text with whatever thought that has been bouncing around my noggin, giving it more meaning than it deserves. I would never say I take them seriously enough to change myself, but why wouldn't I allow it to give me that smirk and dwell on a moment of "what if"? 

Similarly, when I'm listening to music on shuffle and a stream of songs plays that feels eerily like my thoughts are being read, I can't help but get lost in the idea of "ya know, maybe I needed to hear this, I wonder what's next?". Nowadays, that feeling is more replaced with terror as I realize that maybe Spotify and it's algorithms are getting too good at reading my digital footprint and I need to detox a bit. A good curated experience is a wonderful thing if desired, but what happened to true random? They tell us we don't like it, and that our engagement decreases when exposed to it, but what if that true random engages us for as long as needed and dismisses us when we're ready? Like sleeping until your body's alarm wakes you, instead of that weird Samsung beep boop that so many of us are conditioned to swipe snooze at. Instead of every online interaction being a caluclated outcome or trying to autocomplete our thoughts for us, why not allow us as humans to ebb and flow with the media we enjoy? We (unintentionally?) seek to put bounds on experience and avoid the uncomfortable that might come from truly not knowing what we will get. When you can feel that mixture of kismet and mundane, learn to sit with it and enjoy the moment. Whether that extends beyond the resonance of the next emo hit I hear to how we live our lives, hopefully we can all agree on one thing: quit bastardizing our cookies to amass your own fortunes.


PS: I started this rant at 1:14 am and copied an old post template that happened to belong to the first post I wrote which was at 11:14 pm almost 4 years ago, numerology much?
