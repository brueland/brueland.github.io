They say there are two things in life you can never avoid, **death** and **taxes**. However, as a Brueland, there's a third: **projects**. 

The men in my family have an aptitude for starting more pet projects than one single person should, and finishing most of them... eventually. In all honesty, we usually get most of the way though something, get distracted by a new idea, and circle back to the old one when the women in our lives "gently" remind us that the kitchen cabinet doors still need to be reattached before we get too invested in our new rain barrel collection systems.
